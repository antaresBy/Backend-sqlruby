-- SELECT with JOIN practice:
-- Join the OrderDetails and Products tables, to show a report where the columns are OrderID, ProductName, and Quantity.
-- Paste the SQL statement you used below.

SELECT od.OrderID, pr.ProductName, od.Quantity 
    FROM Products AS pr 
INNER JOIN OrderDetails AS od 
    ON od.ProductID = pr.ProductID;


-- Join the Orders, OrderDetails, and Employees tables to return a report with with the EmployeeName, ProductID, and Quantity.
-- Paste the SQL statement you used below.  Hint: EmployeeName is not a column in the Employee table, but you can generate a
-- report with EmployeeName by starting your SQL this way: SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName,

SELECT (Employees.FirstName || " " || Employees.LastName) AS EmployeeName, OrderDetails.ProductID, OrderDetails.Quantity 
	FROM OrderDetails
	INNER JOIN Orders 
		ON Orders.OrderID = OrderDetails.OrderID
	INNER JOIN Employees 
		ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID
